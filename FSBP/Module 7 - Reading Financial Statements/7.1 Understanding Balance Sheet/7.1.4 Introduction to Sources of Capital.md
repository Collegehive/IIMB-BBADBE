Capital is essential for starting and running a business. It's broadly raised from three primary sources:

1.  **Equity Capital:** This is the capital invested by shareholders.
    *   **Initial Investment:** Shareholders contribute equity at the beginning of the business.
    *   **Additional Investment:** They may invest more equity during major expansions or investments.

2.  **Retained Earnings (Internal Equity):** As a company becomes profitable, a portion of the profit is retained and reinvested back into the business. This retained profit acts as an internal source of equity.

3.  **Borrowed Capital (Loan Funds/Debt):** This involves borrowing funds from financial institutions (banks) or the market through various debt instruments.


Financial engineering has introduced innovative methods for raising capital, including:

*   **Convertible Debentures:** These are debt instruments that can be converted into equity shares after a specified period. They offer the security of debt with the potential for equity participation.
*   **Lease Finance:** This is a form of borrowing where a company leases assets instead of purchasing them outright, providing access to capital equipment without a large upfront investment.

** Note** Trade Credit as a Source of Capital- Purchasing goods on credit from suppliers is a common form of short-term financing. It allows businesses to defer payments and manage their cash flow.

## Order of Permanence of Funds

Sources of funds can be ranked by their permanence, from most to least permanent:

1.  **Equity:** Considered the most permanent form of capital as it represents ownership in the company.
2.  **Long-Term Debt:** Debt with a maturity of more than one year.
3.  **Short-Term Debt:** Debt with a maturity of less than one year.
4.  **Dues to Suppliers (Trade Credit):** Represents credit extended by suppliers for goods purchased. This is also a source of short-term financing.
