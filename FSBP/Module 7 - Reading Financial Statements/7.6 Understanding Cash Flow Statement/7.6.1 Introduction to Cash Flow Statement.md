#  Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement explains the changes in a company's cash balance over a period. It summarizes all cash transactions, showing how the opening cash balance transitions to the closing cash balance.

## Basic Concept

If a business has an opening cash balance of ₹120 lakhs and a closing cash balance of ₹150 lakhs, the cash flow statement details how this ₹30 lakh increase occurred.

## Three Activities

1.  **Operating Activities:** Cash flows generated from the core business operations (manufacturing and selling paints and related services).
2.  **Investing Activities:** Cash flows related to the purchase and sale of long-term assets (machinery, equipment, financial assets).
3.  **Financing Activities:** Cash flows related to transactions with capital providers (borrowing, issuing equity, repaying loans, repurchasing shares, paying interest and dividends).
