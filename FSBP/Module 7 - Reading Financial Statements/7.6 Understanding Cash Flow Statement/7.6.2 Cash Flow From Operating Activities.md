# Cash Flow from Operating Activities: Direct and Indirect Methods



## 1. Direct Method

The direct method is straightforward and easy to understand. It directly shows the cash inflows and outflows from operating activities.
**Example:**

*   **Cash Collection from Sales:** Includes cash sales and cash collected from customers on credit sales during the period.
*   **Cash Paid for Raw Material, Labor, and Other Expenses:** Represents payments to suppliers, employees, and other service providers.
*   **Net Cash from Operating Activities:** The difference between cash inflows (collections) and cash outflows (payments).

## 2. Indirect Method

The indirect method is more complex. It starts with profit after tax (calculated on an accrual basis) and adjusts it for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at cash from operating activities.

**Process:**

1.  **Start with Profit After Tax (PAT):** This is the net income from the income statement.
2.  **Add Back Non-Cash Expenses:** These are expenses that reduce profit but don't involve a cash outflow (e.g., depreciation, amortization).
3.  **Add Back Provisions and Other Liabilities:** These represent expenses recognized but not yet paid in cash.
4.  **Adjust for Changes in Current Assets and Liabilities:** These adjustments reflect the difference between accrual accounting and cash accounting.

**Example of Adjusting for Changes in Receivables:**

*   Opening Receivables: ₹100
*   Closing Receivables: ₹60
*   Credit Sales: ₹500

**Calculation of Cash Collected from Customers:**

Opening Receivables + Credit Sales - Cash Collected = Closing Receivables

₹100 + ₹500 - Cash Collected = ₹60

Cash Collected = ₹100 + ₹500 - ₹60 = ₹540

**Explanation:**

*   The income statement recognizes ₹500 as revenue (credit sales).
*   However, the actual cash collected is ₹540.
*   The difference (₹40) is due to the decrease in receivables (₹100 - ₹60).
*   By adding back the decrease in receivables (₹40) to the sales value (₹500), we arrive at the cash collected (₹540).

**General Rule for Adjustments:**

*   **Decrease in Current Assets (e.g., Receivables, Inventory):** Add back to PAT.
*   **Increase in Current Assets:** Deduct from PAT.
*   **Increase in Current Liabilities (e.g., Payables):** Add back to PAT.
*   **Decrease in Current Liabilities:** Deduct from PAT.
