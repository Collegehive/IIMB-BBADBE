# Current Liabilities


## What are Current Liabilities?

Current liabilities are obligations that a company expects to settle within one year. They represent short-term financial commitments.

Many items can appear under both current and non-current liabilities, depending on their maturity date. For example:

*   **Lease Rent Payable:**
    *   Lease payments due within one year are classified as *current liabilities*.
    *   Lease payments due after one year are classified as *non-current liabilities*.

This distinction is crucial for understanding a company's short-term and long-term financial obligations.

## Key Components of Current Liabilities

A primary component of current liabilities is **Trade Payables**.

*   **Trade Payables:** These represent amounts owed to suppliers for goods and services purchased on credit. They are a crucial aspect of a company's working capital.
*   **Disclosure Requirements:** Companies are often required to disclose amounts due to micro-enterprises separately within trade payables. This is important for transparency and supporting smaller businesses.

## Example: Asian Paints' Capital Structure

The provided information about Asian Paints' capital structure offers insight into how the company is financed:

*   **Total Capital:** ₹13,587.68 crore
*   **Sources of Capital:**
    *   **Shareholders' Contribution (Equity):** ₹9,453.29 crore
    *   **Long-Term Lenders (Non-Current Liabilities):** ₹939.28 crore
    *   **Short-Term Lenders and Suppliers (Current Liabilities):** ₹3,195.05 crore

This breakdown shows the proportion of funding from different sources: equity, long-term debt, and short-term debt (including trade payables).

## Analysis of Asian Paints' Funding

The data reveals that Asian Paints relies heavily on equity financing (shareholders' contributions). Short-term funding from lenders and suppliers also plays a significant role. The proportion of long-term debt is relatively smaller. This capital structure gives an insight into the company's risk profile and financial strategy.
