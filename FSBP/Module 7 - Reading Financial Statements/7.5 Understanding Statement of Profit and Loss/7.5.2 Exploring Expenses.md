## 1. Cost of Materials Consumed

*   **Raw Materials:** Chemicals mixed to produce paint.
*   **Packing Material:** Crucial for maintaining paint quality, constituting ~20% of the cost.
*   **Calculation:** Raw Material Consumed = Opening Stock + Purchases - Closing Stock

## 2. Purchase of Stock in Trade

*   Paints purchased from contract manufacturers (small and medium-sized companies producing for larger companies).

## 3. Difference Between Opening and Closing Stock of Finished Goods and Work in Progress (WIP)

This section explains how changes in inventory affect profit calculation.

*   **Example:**
    *   Raw material issued: ₹100
    *   Production expenses: ₹200
    *   Goods transferred to sales: ₹300
    *   Opening finished goods inventory: ₹60
    *   Sales: ₹280 (revenue ₹350)

*   **Calculating Closing Finished Goods Stock:** ₹60 (Opening) + ₹300 (Production) - ₹280 (Sales) = ₹80

*   **Profit Calculation (Two Methods):**

    *   **Method 1 (Using Cost of Sales):**
        *   Sales: ₹350
        *   Cost of Sales: ₹280
        *   Profit: ₹70

    *   **Method 2 (Using Change in Finished Goods Value):**
        *   Sales: ₹350
        *   Material Consumed: ₹100
        *   Expenses Incurred: ₹200
        *   Increase in Finished Goods Value (₹80 - ₹60): ₹20
        *   Profit: ₹350 - ₹100 - ₹200 + ₹20 = ₹70

*   **Key Takeaway:** If cost of sales is unavailable, the change in finished goods and WIP stock value is used. An increase in value is added, while a decrease is deducted.

## 4. Employee Benefit Expenses

*   Includes salaries, provident fund contributions, health insurance, and retirement benefits.
*   Asian Paints spent ₹985.43 crore, a ~10% increase year-over-year.

## 5. Other Expenses

*   A broad category with 27 items, including:
    *   Freight and handling (largest component due to paint being a bulky commodity)
    *   Advertisement
    *   Processing charges
    *   Travel
    *   Repairs and maintenance
    *   Power and fuel (relatively low, indicating the paint industry is not power-intensive).

*   **Categorization:**
    *   **Production/Operations:** ₹1453 crore (marginal increase YoY)
    *   **Marketing:** ₹804 crore (₹100 crore increase YoY, ~5% of sales value). Includes allowances for doubtful debts/bad debts.
    *   **Administration:** ₹588 crore (travel is a major component).

## 6. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

*   Indian companies are required to spend 2% of average profits on CSR activities (community development, education, healthcare, etc.).
*   Asian Paints spent ~₹75 crore.


## 7. Profit Measures

*   **Profit Before Depreciation, Interest, and Taxes (PBDIT) / Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA):** Same concept. Asian Paints reported ₹4,215 crore (11% increase YoY, compared to 5% revenue growth, indicating economies of scale and cost control).
*   **Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT):** PBDIT - Depreciation (Asian Paints: ₹3,525 crore).
*   **Profit Before Taxes (PBT):** PBIT - Interest (Asian Paints: ₹3,446.23 crore). Low interest due to strong cash position.
*   **Profit After Taxes (PAT):** PBT - Taxes (Asian Paints: ₹2,687 crore, 26% increase YoY, primarily due to lower tax expenses).

*   **Tax Expenses:**
    *   **Current Tax:** Tax paid/payable as per tax laws.
    *   **Deferred Tax:** Taxes postponed due to investments (not related to operational efficiency). Therefore, PAT is less emphasized in business performance analysis.

## 8. Exceptional Items

*   Unusual or infrequent gains or losses (e.g., losses from a fire accident). Reported separately and not emphasized in routine analysis.


 Accrual Accounting 

*   Income statements are based on accrual accounting (revenue recognized when earned, not necessarily when collected).
