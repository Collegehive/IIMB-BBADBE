# Statement of Profit and Loss (Income Statement)

## What is the Income Statement?

The Income Statement reports a company's financial performance over a specific period (e.g., a year, a quarter). It shows revenues, expenses, and the resulting profit or loss. It has a start and end date, defining the period it covers.

## Structure of the Income Statement

The Income Statement has two main sections:

1.  **Income (Revenue):** Represents the inflow of economic benefits from the company's ordinary activities.
2.  **Expenses:** Represent the outflow or consumption of economic benefits during the period.

The difference between income and expenses results in profit or loss. Profits are measured at different levels:

*   **Profit Before Depreciation, Interest, and Taxes (PBDIT):** Profit before deducting depreciation, interest expense, and income taxes.
*   **Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT or EBIT):** Profit before deducting interest expense and income taxes. This is often used for analysis purposes.
*   **Profit Before Taxes (PBT):** Profit before deducting income taxes.
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT):** Net profit after deducting all expenses, including taxes.

This section includes:

*   **Revenue from Sale of Products:** Revenue generated from selling goods. In the case of Asian Paints, this is the revenue from selling paints and related products.
*   **Revenue from Sale of Services:** Revenue generated from providing services. For Asian Paints, this includes painting and consultancy services.
*   **Other Operating Revenues:** Revenue from activities related to core operations but not directly from product sales or services. Examples include processing charges, scrap sales, and government subsidies.
*   **Other Income:** Income from sources *outside* the company's core operations. This includes:
    *   Interest income
    *   Dividend income
    *   Royalties
    *   Insurance claims
    *   Foreign exchange (forex) gains/losses
    *   Net gain/loss from the sale of assets

Forex gains (or losses) arise from fluctuations in exchange rates when a company engages in international transactions.

*   **Example:** A company exports goods worth USD 100,000 with a 90-day credit period.
    *   **Invoice Date:** USD 1 = ₹80. Revenue is recorded as ₹80 lakh (100,000 * 80).
    *   **Payment Date (90 days later):** USD 1 = ₹82. The company receives ₹82 lakh (100,000 * 82).
    *   **Forex Gain:** ₹2 lakh (₹82 lakh - ₹80 lakh).

This forex gain is part of other income.

Importance of Different Income Components
*   **Other Income:** While it contributes to overall profit, it's generally considered less reliable for performance assessment because it's not directly related to core operations and can fluctuate significantly from year to year.
