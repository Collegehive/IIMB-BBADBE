# Depreciation Methods and Their Impact

This document discusses various depreciation methods and their impact on depreciation expense and per-unit cost. We'll analyze four methods using an example of Jupiter Industries.

## Scenario: Jupiter Industries

*   Machine Cost: ₹6,000,000 (₹60 Lakhs)
*   Useful Life: 10 years
*   Salvage Value: ₹0
*   Expected Production: 3,000 units over 10 years (varying production per year)

**Production Schedule:**

*   Years 1-2: 100 units/year
*   Years 3-4: 200 units/year
*   Years 5-6: 300 units/year
*   Years 7-8: 400 units/year
*   Years 9-10: 500 units/year

## Depreciation Methods and Calculations

We'll calculate the annual depreciation and depreciation per unit for each method.

### 1. Units of Production Method

*   Depreciation per unit: ₹6,000,000 / 3,000 units = ₹2,000/unit
*   Annual Depreciation: Depreciation per unit * Units produced in that year.

| Year | Production | Depreciation | Depreciation per Unit |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 1-2  | 100        | ₹200,000     | ₹2,000                |
| 3-4  | 200        | ₹400,000     | ₹2,000                |
| 5-6  | 300        | ₹600,000     | ₹2,000                |
| 7-8  | 400        | ₹800,000     | ₹2,000                |
| 9-10 | 500        | ₹1,000,000   | ₹2,000                |

### 2. Straight-Line Method

*   Annual Depreciation: ₹6,000,000 / 10 years = ₹600,000/year
*   Depreciation per Unit: Annual Depreciation / Units produced in that year.

| Year | Production | Depreciation | Depreciation per Unit |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 1-2  | 100        | ₹600,000     | ₹6,000                |
| 3-4  | 200        | ₹600,000     | ₹3,000                |
| 5-6  | 300        | ₹600,000     | ₹2,000                |
| 7-8  | 400        | ₹600,000     | ₹1,500                |
| 9-10 | 500        | ₹600,000     | ₹1,200                |

### 3. Written Down Value (WDV) Method (20%)

*   Depreciation in Year *n*: (Book Value at the beginning of Year *n*) \* 20%

| Year | Production | Book Value (Beginning) | Depreciation | Depreciation per Unit |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 1    | 100        | ₹6,000,000             | ₹1,200,000   | ₹12,000               |
| 2    | 100        | ₹4,800,000             | ₹960,000     | ₹9,600                |
| 3    | 200        | ₹3,840,000             | ₹768,000     | ₹3,840                |
| 4    | 200        | ₹3,072,000             | ₹614,400     | ₹3,072                |
| 5    | 300        | ₹2,457,600             | ₹491,520     | ₹1,638                |
| 6    | 300        | ₹1,966,080             | ₹393,216     | ₹1,311                |
| 7    | 400        | ₹1,572,864             | ₹314,573     | ₹786                  |
| 8    | 400        | ₹1,258,291             | ₹251,658     | ₹629                  |
| 9    | 500        | ₹1,006,633             | ₹201,327     | ₹403                  |
| 10   | 500        | ₹805,306              | ₹161,061     | ₹322                  |

### 4. Sum of the Years' Digits Method

*   Sum of the Years' Digits: (10 * 11) / 2 = 55
*   Depreciation in Year *n*: (Remaining Useful Life at the beginning of Year *n* / Sum of the Years' Digits) \* Original Cost

| Year | Production | Depreciation | Depreciation per Unit |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 1    | 100        | ₹1,090,909   | ₹10,909               |
| 2    | 100        | ₹981,818     | ₹9,818                |
| 3    | 200        | ₹872,727     | ₹4,364                |
| 4    | 200        | ₹763,636     | ₹3,818                |
| 5    | 300        | ₹654,545     | ₹2,182                |
| 6    | 300        | ₹545,455     | ₹1,818                |
| 7    | 400        | ₹436,364     | ₹1,091                |
| 8    | 400        | ₹327,273     | ₹818                  |
| 9    | 500        | ₹218,182     | ₹436                  |
| 10   | 500        | ₹109,091     | ₹218                  |

## Analysis and Appropriateness of Methods

*   **Units of Production:** Depreciation per unit remains constant. This method is most appropriate when depreciation is directly related to usage, and output can be reliably measured. It directly links expense with revenue generation.
*   **Straight-Line:** Simple to calculate and results in a constant annual depreciation expense. However, it doesn't reflect actual usage patterns, especially when production varies significantly.
*   **WDV:** Results in higher depreciation expense in the early years and lower expense in later years. This can be suitable for assets that experience rapid obsolescence or higher maintenance costs in later years. However, it never fully depreciates the asset to zero.
*   **Sum of the Years' Digits:** Similar to WDV, it results in higher depreciation in early years and lower depreciation in later years. It does fully depreciate the asset over its useful life.

**Standard Deviation of Depreciation per Unit:**

This metric measures the variability of depreciation expense per unit. A lower standard deviation indicates a more stable per-unit cost.

| Method             | Standard Deviation | Preference Ranking |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Units of Production | 0                  | 1 (Most Preferred) |
| Straight-Line      | ₹1,835             | 2                  |
| WDV                | ₹4,125             | 4 (Least Preferred) |
| Sum of the Digits  | ₹3,849             | 3                  |

# Accounting for Asset Disposal and Depreciation

This document explains the accounting entries for asset disposal after charging depreciation, using two examples with different depreciation methods.

## Scenario: Regal Paints

Regal Paints replaces machines periodically. We have details for two machines:

**Machine 101:**

*   Purchase Date: January 1, 2016
*   Purchase Value: ₹500,000
*   Sale Date: May 31, 2024
*   Sale Price: ₹150,000
*   Depreciation Method: Straight-line (10%)
*   Accounting Year: April to March
*   Depreciation Policy:
    *   Purchase before October 1st: Full-year depreciation.
    *   Purchase on/after October 1st: 50% depreciation.
    *   Sale before October 1st: 50% depreciation in the year of sale.
    *   Sale on/after October 1st: Full-year depreciation in the year of sale.

**Machine 502:**

*   Purchase Date: May 1, 2018
*   Purchase Value: ₹600,000
*   Sale Date: November 30, 2023
*   Sale Price: ₹300,000
*   Depreciation Method: Written Down Value (WDV) (20%)
*   Accounting Year: April to March
*   Depreciation Policy: Same as Machine 101.

## Accounting Equation Framework

We'll use the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) to record the transactions. For clarity, we'll include revenue and expenses as well:

Assets (Cash, Machine, Accumulated Depreciation) = Liabilities + Equity + Revenue - Expenses

## Machine 101: Straight-Line Depreciation

| Date       | Transaction                 | Cash      | Machine   | Accum. Depr. | Liabilities | Equity | Revenue | Expenses  |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| Jan 1, 2016| Purchase                    | -₹500,000 | +₹500,000 |               |             |        |         |           |
| Mar 31, 2016| Depreciation (50%)         |           |           | -₹25,000      |             |        |         | -₹25,000  |
| Mar 31, 2017| Depreciation (100%)        |           |           | -₹50,000      |             |        |         | -₹50,000  |
| Mar 31, 2018| Depreciation (100%)        |           |           | -₹50,000      |             |        |         | -₹50,000  |
| Mar 31, 2019| Depreciation (100%)        |           |           | -₹50,000      |             |        |         | -₹50,000  |
| Mar 31, 2020| Depreciation (100%)        |           |           | -₹50,000      |             |        |         | -₹50,000  |
| Mar 31, 2021| Depreciation (100%)        |           |           | -₹50,000      |             |        |         | -₹50,000  |
| Mar 31, 2022| Depreciation (100%)        |           |           | -₹50,000      |             |        |         | -₹50,000  |
| Mar 31, 2023| Depreciation (100%)        |           |           | -₹50,000      |             |        |         | -₹50,000  |
| May 31, 2024| Depreciation (50%)         |           |           | -₹25,000      |             |        |         | -₹25,000  |
| May 31, 2024| Sale                        | +₹150,000 | -₹500,000 | +₹450,000     |             |        | +₹100,000|           |

**Profit on Sale:**

Book Value at Sale = ₹500,000 (Cost) - ₹450,000 (Accumulated Depreciation) = ₹50,000.

Profit = ₹150,000 (Sale Price) - ₹50,000 (Book Value) = ₹100,000.

## Machine 502: Written Down Value (WDV) Depreciation

| Date        | Transaction                 | Cash      | Machine   | Accum. Depr. | Liabilities | Equity | Revenue | Expenses  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| May 1, 2018 | Purchase                    | -₹600,000 | +₹600,000 |               |             |        |         |           |
| Mar 31, 2019| Depreciation (100%)         |           |           | -₹120,000     |             |        |         | -₹120,000 |
| Mar 31, 2020| Depreciation (100%)         |           |           | -₹96,000      |             |        |         | -₹96,000  |
| Mar 31, 2021| Depreciation (100%)         |           |           | -₹76,800      |             |        |         | -₹76,800  |
| Mar 31, 2022| Depreciation (100%)         |           |           | -₹61,440      |             |        |         | -₹61,440  |
| Mar 31, 2023| Depreciation (100%)         |           |           | -₹49,152      |             |        |         | -₹49,152  |
| Nov 30, 2023| Depreciation (100%)         |           |           | -₹39,322      |             |        |         | -₹39,322  |
| Nov 30, 2023| Sale                        | +₹300,000 | -₹600,000 | +₹442,714     |             |        | +₹142,714|           |

**Profit on Sale:**

Accumulated Depreciation = ₹120,000+₹96,000+₹76,800+₹61,440+₹49,152+₹39,322 = ₹442,714

Book Value at Sale = ₹600,000 (Cost) - ₹442,714 (Accumulated Depreciation) = ₹157,286

Profit = ₹300,000 (Sale Price) - ₹157,286 (Book Value) = ₹142,714

## Key Points

*   When an asset is sold, both the asset account and the accumulated depreciation account are reversed.
*   The difference between the sale price and the book value of the asset results in a profit or loss on disposal, which is recorded in the income statement.
*   The depreciation policy regarding purchases and sales before or after October 1st affects the depreciation expense charged in the first and last years of the asset's life.
*   The accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Revenue - Expenses) remains balanced after each transaction.

This detailed explanation clarifies the accounting entries for asset disposal under both straight-line and written-down value depreciation methods.

# Accounting for Fixed Asset Exchanges

When a business buys a fixed asset, it may exchange an old asset for a new one. The accounting treatment for these exchanges depends on whether the assets exchanged are similar or dissimilar.

## Key Principles

*   **Similar Assets:** If the assets exchanged are similar (e.g., exchanging an old bus for a new bus), the transaction is considered an exchange, not a sale. Profit or loss on the disposal of the old asset is *not* recognized at the time of the exchange. The new asset is recorded at the book value of the old asset plus any cash paid.
*   **Dissimilar Assets:** If the assets exchanged are dissimilar (e.g., exchanging land for a bus), the transaction is treated as a sale of the old asset and a purchase of the new asset. Profit or loss on the disposal of the old asset *is* recognized.

## Exercise: Jam Transport

Jam Transport operates luxury buses. They recently purchased four new buses, each costing ₹90 lakh.

### Scenario 1: Exchange of Similar Assets (Old Buses for New Buses)

*   **Exchange:** Two old buses (original cost ₹140 lakh, accumulated depreciation ₹100 lakh, net book value ₹40 lakh) for two new buses.
*   **Cash Paid:** ₹120 lakh.

**Accounting Entries:**

| Account                      | Debit (₹ Lakh) | Credit (₹ Lakh) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Cash                         |                | 120             |
| Old Buses                    |                | 140             |
| Accumulated Depreciation     | 100            |                 |
| New Buses                    | 160            |                 |

**Explanation:**

The value of the new buses is calculated as follows:

New Bus Value = Cash Paid + Book Value of Old Buses

New Bus Value = ₹120 lakh + (₹140 lakh - ₹100 lakh) = ₹160 lakh

No profit or loss is recognized on the exchange of similar assets. The new buses are recorded at ₹160 lakh, which represents the cost of acquiring them through the exchange.

### Scenario 2: Exchange of Dissimilar Assets (Land for New Buses)

*   **Exchange:** A piece of land (original cost ₹20 lakh, current market value ₹70 lakh) for two new buses.
*   **Cash Paid:** ₹100 lakh.

**Two possible approaches depending on the certainty of the new bus's fair value:**

**Approach 1: Fair value of new buses is reliably measurable (₹180 Lakh)**

**Accounting Entries:**

| Account                | Debit (₹ Lakh) | Credit (₹ Lakh) |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Cash                   |                | 100             |
| Land                   |                | 20              |
| New Buses              | 180            |                 |
| Profit on Sale of Land |                | 60              |

**Explanation:**

Since the fair value of the new buses (₹180 lakh) is known, we use this value. The profit on the sale of land is calculated as the difference:

Profit = New Bus Value + Cash paid - Original Cost of Land

Profit = ₹180 lakh + ₹100 lakh - ₹20 Lakh = ₹160 Lakh.

If we look at it in another way:

Profit = Fair value of Land + Cash Paid - Original Cost of Land

Profit = ₹70 Lakh + ₹100 Lakh - ₹20 Lakh = ₹150 Lakh.

There seems to be an error in the original calculation of profit. It should be 150 Lakh, not 60 Lakh. The correct entry should be:

| Account                | Debit (₹ Lakh) | Credit (₹ Lakh) |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Cash                   |                | 100             |
| Land                   |                | 20              |
| New Buses              | 180            |                 |
| Profit on Sale of Land |                | 150              |

**Approach 2: Fair value of new buses is *not* reliably measurable**

If the fair value of the new buses is uncertain, we first calculate the profit on the sale of land based on its market value:

Profit on Sale of Land = Market Value of Land - Original Cost of Land

Profit on Sale of Land = ₹70 lakh - ₹20 lakh = ₹50 lakh

**Accounting Entries:**

| Account                | Debit (₹ Lakh) | Credit (₹ Lakh) |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Cash                   |                | 100             |
| Land                   |                | 20              |
| Profit on Sale of Land |                | 50              |
| New Buses              | 170            |                 |

**Explanation:**

In this case, the value of the new buses (₹170 lakh) becomes the balancing figure.

New Bus Value = Cash Paid + Fair Value of Land

New Bus Value = ₹100 lakh + ₹70 Lakh = ₹170 Lakh

## Key Takeaway

The crucial factor determining the accounting treatment is whether the fair value of the asset received in the exchange can be reliably determined. If it can, that value is used to record the new asset, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. If the fair value cannot be reliably determined, the fair value of the asset given up is used, and the new asset is recorded at a value that balances the accounting equation.
