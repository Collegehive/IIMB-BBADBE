# Non-Current Assets

## What are Non-Current Assets?

Non-current assets are long-term investments that a company does not expect to convert to cash or consume within one year. They are held for continued use in business operations.

## Key Components of Non-Current Assets

1.  **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** These are tangible assets used in operations.

    *   **Components:** Land, buildings, plant and machinery, equipment (including research equipment), furniture and fixtures, vehicles, office equipment, and computer hardware.
    
    *   **Intangible Assets:** These are non-physical assets that provide future economic benefits. Examples include trademarks, software, goodwill, and brand value. They are treated similarly to tangible assets, with accumulated amortization instead of depreciation.
      

2.  **Right-of-Use Assets:** These represent a lessee's right to use an asset under a lease agreement.

3.  **Capital Work in Progress (CWIP):** This represents the cost of assets under construction. Once the construction is complete, the asset is transferred to PP&E. It's important to exclude CWIP when analyzing business performance, as these assets are not yet generating revenue.

4.  **Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (excluding those already mentioned):** This includes any remaining intangible assets not specifically categorized.

5.  **Investments in Subsidiaries and Associated Companies:** These are long-term investments in other companies.

6.  **Financial Assets (Non-Current):** These are long-term investments in financial instruments such as mutual funds, equity, and bonds.

7.  **Current Tax Assets:** These are advance tax payments. They are similar to prepaid expenses and will be adjusted once the final tax assessment is completed.

8.  **Other Non-Current Assets:** This is a catch-all category for miscellaneous non-current assets that don't fit into other categories.
