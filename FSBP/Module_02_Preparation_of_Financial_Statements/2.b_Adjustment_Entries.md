# Adjusting Journal Entries: A Comprehensive Guide
# Adjustment Entries: Definition

Adjustment entries are journal entries made at the end of an accounting period to correct errors or to match revenues and expenses to the proper accounting period. They are crucial for ensuring that a company's financial statements accurately reflect its financial position and performance.

## Why Adjustment Entries are Necessary

Accountants typically record transactions when supporting documents, such as invoices or bank statements, are available. However, some economic events occur for which immediate documentation isn't available. Ignoring these events would lead to an inaccurate representation of the company's financial status, understating expenses and overstating profits.

Adjustment entries address this by recognizing:

*   Expenses incurred but not yet paid.
*   Revenues earned but not yet received.
*   The proper allocation of expenses and revenues across accounting periods.

## Types of Adjustment Entries

Adjustment entries can be broadly classified based on their impact on:

*   **Income Statement:** Adjustments affecting revenues and expenses.
*   **Balance Sheet:** Adjustments affecting assets, liabilities, and equity.

Because of the double-entry bookkeeping system, every adjustment entry affects at least one income statement account and one balance sheet account.

## Adjustment Entries Related to Income

The profit and loss account (income statement) reflects a business's performance (profit or loss), calculated as revenue minus expenses. Accurate measurement of revenue and matching expenses are crucial. Adjustment entries help recognize revenues not recorded through normal accounting procedures.

### 1. Accrued Interest Income

Companies often invest surplus cash in bonds or fixed deposits. Interest on these investments is usually paid periodically (e.g., semi-annually). If the accounting period ends before the interest payment date, the interest earned but not yet received needs to be recognized.

**Example:** A company's accounting period is April to March. Interest earned on a fixed deposit from January 1st to March 31st is not yet due for payment by the bank.

**Adjustment Entry:**

*  Interest Accrued (Balance Sheet - Asset)
*  Interest Income (Income Statement- Credit)

Accrued interest is an asset representing the right to receive future cash. Interest income is credited, following the rule of crediting incomes and profits.

## Adjustment Entries Related to Expenses

Expenses can be paid in advance or after being incurred. Adjustments are necessary to allocate expenses to the correct accounting period.

### 1. Prepaid Expenses (e.g., Insurance)

When expenses are paid in advance, only the portion related to the current accounting period should be recognized as an expense. The remaining portion is treated as a prepaid expense (an asset).

**Example:** A one-year insurance premium is paid in October (12 Lakhs). The accounting period is January to December. Only three months' worth of insurance (3 Lakhs) should be expensed in the current year; the remaining nine months (9 Lakhs) are prepaid.

**Entries:**

### 2. Accrued/Outstanding Expenses (e.g., Electricity)

Expenses incurred but not yet paid or invoiced need to be recognized.

**Example:** Electricity consumed in December is billed in January, 10 lakhs. Paid the amount on 15 January ; Accounting period being Jan-Dec

**Adjustment Entry (End of Year):**

When the bill is paid in January:

### 3. Estimated Expenses (e.g., Bad Debts, Warranty Expenses)

Some expenses, like bad debts or warranty claims, are uncertain in amount but likely to occur. These are estimated and recognized to adhere to the matching principle.

**Example:** Year 1- Estimated amount the customer may go bad or amount the customer may claim as warranty expense is 20 lakhs.
             Year 2- The service replaced a component worth of 5000 against customer's warranty claim.

**Adjustment Entry:**

When a warranty claim is paid:

![Screenshot (231)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4689145-e363-4c78-b452-c7afb9faa326)

*   Stores account is credited as material is a real account.
*   No impact on next year's P&L ; The balance for provision for waranty and stores gets reduced (both balance sheet items)  

### 4. Gratuity Payable to Employees

Gratuity is a lump-sum payment to employees upon retirement or resignation. The matching principle requires recognizing a portion of this expense each year during the employee's service.

**Adjustment Entry:**

![Screenshot (233)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c9cb642-0744-464b-8719-f295cb2c3cf8)

*   Gratuity expense is reported as expense in P&L account and provision for gratuity is reported as liability in balance sheet.

When gratuity is paid:

# Adjustment Entries Related to Assets

## 1. Material/Inventory Consumption

When a business uses raw materials in production, a record needs to be made to reflect this consumption. Often, there's no real-time tracking of material movement from stores to production. Therefore, an adjustment entry is required at the end of the accounting period.

**Calculation of Material Consumed:**

Material Consumed = Opening Stock + Purchases - Closing Stock

**Example:**

*   Opening Stock: ₹10 Lakhs
*   Purchases: ₹400 Lakhs
*   Closing Stock: ₹30 Lakhs

Material Consumed = ₹10 Lakhs + ₹400 Lakhs - ₹30 Lakhs = ₹380 Lakhs

**Adjustment Entry:**

![Screenshot (237)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/760c11ee-0cb3-4904-be62-245f6b6fbace)


This entry reduces the inventory value on the balance sheet and recognizes the cost of goods sold (COGS) on the income statement.
 This adjustment ensures that the cost of materials used in production is matched with the revenue generated from the sale of the finished goods. It is crucial for calculating accurate profit figures.

## 2. Depreciation of Tangible Assets

When a business purchases a tangible asset like machinery, its value decreases over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, etc. This decrease in value is called depreciation.

**Initial Entry:**

When the machine worth 100 lakhs is purchased:

![Screenshot (239)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/624c37dd-c63a-475a-b9e1-1a28dd97806e)

**At the end of year:**
If accountant knows that the machine can run for 10 years, he/she can assume the asset value has come down by 10 percent at the end of the one year.She will now pass an adjustment entry to bring down the value of the asset from 100 lakh rupees to 90 lakh rupees.

![Screenshot (240)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9503d0c-f6c3-4a58-9b10-1faec665bcf4)

The value of the machine in our book will now reduce to 90 lakh rupees. Profit and loss account also bear the expenses of 10 lakh rupees.In the above adjustment entry, we credited machine account to explain how the asset value is reduced to 90 lakh rupees. But in practice accountant will not credit the machine account.

**Adjustment Entry (Depreciation):**

Instead of directly reducing the Machine Account, a contra-asset account called "Accumulated Depreciation" is used.

![Screenshot (242)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd7551a-c114-401e-908a-086e9690a5d1)

**Balance Sheet Presentation:**

The balance sheet shows the original cost of the asset and the accumulated depreciation separately:

*   Machine: ₹100 Lakhs
*   Less: Accumulated Depreciation: ₹10 Lakhs
*   Net Book Value: ₹90 Lakhs

**Subsequent Years:**

The depreciation entry is repeated each year. The accumulated depreciation increases each year, reflecting the total depreciation to date.

**Example (Year 2):**

*   Debit: Depreciation Expense Account ₹10 Lakhs
*   Credit: Accumulated Depreciation Account ₹10 Lakhs

**Balance Sheet (End of Year 2):**

*   Machine: ₹100 Lakhs
*   Less: Accumulated Depreciation: ₹20 Lakhs
*   Net Book Value: ₹80 Lakhs

## 3. Amortization of Intangible Assets

Similar to depreciation for tangible assets, intangible assets (like patents, copyrights, and licenses) are subject to amortization. Amortization is the systematic allocation of the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life.

**Example:**

A telecom company pays for a 20-year spectrum license.

**Adjustment Entry (Amortization - Assuming straight-line amortization):**

![Screenshot (244)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d34d180a-7acc-42fd-944f-0252d2c65fdd)

**Explanation:** This entry recognizes the expense related to the use of the intangible asset over its useful life, matching the expense with the revenue it generates.
# Adjustment Entries Related to Liabilities

## 1. Foreign Currency Fluctuations

When a company has liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, fluctuations in exchange rates create the need for adjustment entries.

**Example:**

A company borrows $1 million from a US bank when the exchange rate is ₹80/$1 and the loan is repayable after 10 years.

**Initial Entry:**

![Screenshot (246)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c01c1c0c-dc39-4247-895c-bfeae32868ae)

**Subsequent Adjustment:**

If the exchange rate changes to ₹90/$1, the company's liability in Indian Rupees has increased.


**Adjustment Entry:**

![Screenshot (248)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bab1a48f-353b-45d6-a159-0fd5957c45bc)

 This entry recognizes the increase in the liability due to the depreciation of the Indian Rupee. It's crucial for accurate reporting of liabilities, even though the actual payment is due later.

**Important Note:** When the exchange rate changes from ₹80/$1 to ₹90/$1, the Indian Rupee has *depreciated* against the US Dollar. This means it takes more Rupees to buy one Dollar.

## 2. Dividends Payable

When a company declares dividends, an adjustment entry is needed to recognize the liability to shareholders.

**Process:**

1.  **Board Resolution:** The board of directors declares a dividend.
2.  **Shareholder Approval:** Shareholders approve the dividend at the annual general meeting.
3.  **Payment:** Dividends are paid to shareholders.

**Adjustment Entry (at the time of board resolution):**

![Screenshot (250)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aefa7e06-ddf4-4425-9147-33d91d32467b)


**Entry at the time of Payment:**

![Screenshot (251)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c07053bb-003f-4134-b02f-93f736d265f8)

 The adjustment entry recognizes the liability in the period the dividend is declared, adhering to the matching principle.

# Adjustments for Revaluation of assets

New accounting standards require companies to revalue their financial assets to fair value (market value) at the end of each reporting period.
## 1. Change in long term assets
  The change in value of long term investments is accounted through Fair value through comprehensive income(FVTOCI).

**Example:**

A company invests ₹100 Lakhs in SBI shares. At the end of the reporting period, the market value of the shares is ₹108 Lakhs.

**Initial Entry:**

![Screenshot (253)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16edfa5b-c2c4-4d51-998a-8ec9cd5a0f11)

**Adjustment Entry:**

![Screenshot (254)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2527d9d3-b365-4984-b1fe-631e12af8081)

Other comprehensive income will be recognizd as a part of other equity.
## 2. Change in Short term assets 
The change in the value of short term investments is accounted through Fair value through Profit and Loss(FVTPL).

Trading Securities (Short-Term):
No change will be in initial entry but in adjustment entry, we will make the following change:-

![Screenshot (256)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9992ccd8-49b3-4a85-b4fc-998d6d5a9212)

The FVTPL account is part of the income statement, affecting net income.

**Key Differences between FVTPL and FVTOCI:**

| Feature         | FVTPL                                   | FVTOCI                                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Impact on       | Profit and Loss (Income Statement)      | Other Comprehensive Income (Equity)        |
| Realization     | Changes recognized immediately in profit | Changes accumulate in OCI until the asset is sold, then recycled to profit. |
| Investment Type | Short-term/Trading                      | Long-term/Strategic                        |

**Recap Questions:**

1.  **Do we need to recognize the notional profit/loss of our financial asset?** Yes, under current accounting standards.
2.  **Where do we account for this notional profit/loss?** It depends on the investment's classification (short-term/long-term). Short-term goes to FVTPL (Income Statement). Long-term goes to FVTOCI (Equity).

**Equity Presentation:**

The balance sheet often presents equity under a general heading "Equity," which includes:

*   Equity Share Capital
*   Other Equity (including retained earnings and accumulated OCI)

## Conclusion

Adjustment entries are essential for accurate financial reporting, particularly on the liability side. They ensure that liabilities are reported at their current value, dividends are recognized in the correct period, and financial assets are reflected at fair value. This leads to a more accurate and complete picture of a company's financial position.
