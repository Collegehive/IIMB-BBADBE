# Adjusting Journal Entries: A Comprehensive Guide
# Adjustment Entries: Definition

Adjustment entries are journal entries made at the end of an accounting period to correct errors or to match revenues and expenses to the proper accounting period. They are crucial for ensuring that a company's financial statements accurately reflect its financial position and performance.

## Why Adjustment Entries are Necessary

Accountants typically record transactions when supporting documents, such as invoices or bank statements, are available. However, some economic events occur for which immediate documentation isn't available. Ignoring these events would lead to an inaccurate representation of the company's financial status, understating expenses and overstating profits.

Adjustment entries address this by recognizing:

*   Expenses incurred but not yet paid.
*   Revenues earned but not yet received.
*   The proper allocation of expenses and revenues across accounting periods.

## Types of Adjustment Entries

Adjustment entries can be broadly classified based on their impact on:

*   **Income Statement:** Adjustments affecting revenues and expenses.
*   **Balance Sheet:** Adjustments affecting assets, liabilities, and equity.

Because of the double-entry bookkeeping system, every adjustment entry affects at least one income statement account and one balance sheet account.

## Adjustment Entries Related to Income

The profit and loss account (income statement) reflects a business's performance (profit or loss), calculated as revenue minus expenses. Accurate measurement of revenue and matching expenses are crucial. Adjustment entries help recognize revenues not recorded through normal accounting procedures.

### 1. Accrued Interest Income

Companies often invest surplus cash in bonds or fixed deposits. Interest on these investments is usually paid periodically (e.g., semi-annually). If the accounting period ends before the interest payment date, the interest earned but not yet received needs to be recognized.

**Example:** A company's accounting period is April to March. Interest earned on a fixed deposit from January 1st to March 31st is not yet due for payment by the bank.

*  Interest Accrued (Balance Sheet - Asset)
*  Interest Income (Income Statement- Credit)

Accrued interest is an asset representing the right to receive future cash. Interest income is credited, following the rule of crediting incomes and profits.

## Adjustment Entries Related to Expenses

Expenses can be paid in advance or after being incurred. Adjustments are necessary to allocate expenses to the correct accounting period.

### 1. Prepaid Expenses (e.g., Insurance)

When expenses are paid in advance, only the portion related to the current accounting period should be recognized as an expense. The remaining portion is treated as a prepaid expense (an asset).

**Example:** A one-year insurance premium is paid in October (12 Lakhs). The accounting period is January to December. Only three months' worth of insurance (3 Lakhs) should be expensed in the current year; the remaining nine months (9 Lakhs) are prepaid.

### 2. Accrued/Outstanding Expenses (e.g., Electricity)

Expenses incurred but not yet paid or invoiced need to be recognized.

**Example:** Electricity consumed in December is billed in January, 10 lakhs. Paid the amount on 15 January ; Accounting period being Jan-Dec

### 3. Estimated Expenses (e.g., Bad Debts, Warranty Expenses)

Some expenses, like bad debts or warranty claims, are uncertain in amount but likely to occur. These are estimated and recognized to adhere to the matching principle.

**Example:** Year 1- Estimated amount the customer may go bad or amount the customer may claim as warranty expense is 20 lakhs.
             Year 2- The service replaced a component worth of 5000 against customer's warranty claim.

*   Stores account is credited as material is a real account.
*   No impact on next year's P&L ; The balance for provision for waranty and stores gets reduced (both balance sheet items)  

### 4. Gratuity Payable to Employees

Gratuity is a lump-sum payment to employees upon retirement or resignation. The matching principle requires recognizing a portion of this expense each year during the employee's service.

**Adjustment Entry:**

*   Gratuity expense is reported as expense in P&L account and provision for gratuity is reported as liability in balance sheet.

When gratuity is paid:

## Conclusion

Adjustment entries are essential for accurate financial reporting. They ensure that revenues and expenses are recognized in the correct accounting period, providing a true and fair view of a business's financial performance and position. By addressing transactions lacking immediate documentation and applying key accounting principles like the matching principle, these adjustments enhance the reliability and relevance of financial statements.
