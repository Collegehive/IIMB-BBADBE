# Inventory Accounting Methods and Their Impact on Net Income

This document discusses different methods of inventory accounting (FIFO, LIFO, and Weighted Average) and their impact on net income. It also explains how costs flow from raw materials to work-in-progress, finished goods, and finally to the profit and loss (P&L) account. Several examples are provided to illustrate these concepts.



## Example 1: Ajanta Electrical and Company (Periodic Inventory)

Ajanta Electrical sells Compton fans.

*   Beginning Inventory (Jan 1): 3,000 units @ ₹600/unit
*   Purchases (Jan): 15,000 units @ ₹620/unit
*   Sales (Jan): 14,000 units @ ₹720/unit

Here's the profit calculation using each method:

| Method        | Sales (14,000 x ₹720) | Cost of Sales Calculation                                     | Cost of Sales | Profit        |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| FIFO          | ₹10,080,000         | (3,000 x ₹600) + (11,000 x ₹620)                               | ₹8,620,000   | ₹1,460,000   |
| LIFO          | ₹10,080,000         | 14,000 x ₹620                                                 | ₹8,680,000   | ₹1,400,000   |
| Weighted Avg. | ₹10,080,000         | \[ (3,000 x ₹600) + (15,000 x ₹620) ] / 18,000 \* 14000         | ₹8,633,333   | ₹1,446,667   |

## Example 2: Cutfast Engineering (Perpetual Inventory)

**Key Takeaways from Cutfast Engineering Example:**

*   **FIFO:** The cost of goods sold is calculated based on the oldest inventory remaining after each sale.
*   **LIFO:** The cost of goods sold is calculated based on the most recent inventory purchased before each sale. The calculations become more complex as multiple purchases are made.
*   **Weighted Average:** A new weighted average cost is calculated after each purchase. This average cost is then applied to each sale until the next purchase. This method simplifies the calculations significantly compared to FIFO and LIFO in a perpetual system.

**Comparison of Consumption Value and Inventory Value:**

| Method        | Consumption Value | Ending Inventory Value |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| FIFO          | ₹12,82,000         | ₹28,000                 |
| LIFO          | ₹12,85,000         | ₹25,000                 |
| Weighted Avg. | ₹12,82,761         | ₹27,239                 |

## Conclusion

The choice of inventory accounting method can significantly impact a company's financial statements, especially during periods of price fluctuations.

*   FIFO is often used when inventory items have a short shelf life or are easily perishable.
*   LIFO is used for tax advantages (where permitted) during periods of rising prices.
*   Weighted Average is a simpler method and smooths out the effects of price changes, making it a commonly used method.

It's crucial for businesses to choose an inventory accounting method that accurately reflects their operations and complies with accounting standards. Consistency in applying the chosen method is essential for comparability of financial statements over time.

# Impact of Inventory Accounting on Profit and Cash Flow

This document analyzes the impact of different inventory accounting methods (FIFO, LIFO, and Weighted Average) on profit and cash flow. We'll use an example of Digital World, a dealer of HP laptops.

## Scenario: Digital World

*   Purchases:
    *   1,200 units @ ₹60,000/unit
    *   1,800 units @ ₹70,000/unit
*   Sales: 2,500 units @ ₹80,000/unit
*   Tax Rate: 30%

## Part 1: Profit After Tax

First, we calculate the profit after tax under each method.

**Sales:**

Sales revenue is the same regardless of the inventory method: 2,500 units * ₹80,000/unit = ₹200,000,000 (₹200,000 in thousands).

**Cost of Sales:**

The cost of sales varies depending on the inventory method:

*   **FIFO:** (1,200 units * ₹60,000/unit) + (1,300 units * ₹70,000/unit) = ₹163,000,000 (₹163,000 in thousands)
*   **LIFO:** (1,800 units * ₹70,000/unit) + (700 units * ₹60,000/unit) = ₹168,000,000 (₹168,000 in thousands)
*   **Weighted Average:** \[(1,200 * ₹60,000) + (1,800 * ₹70,000)] / 3,000 = ₹66,000/unit (Average Cost). Cost of Sales = 2,500 units * ₹66,000/unit = ₹165,000,000 (₹165,000 in thousands)

**Profit Before Tax:**

Profit before tax is calculated as Sales - Cost of Sales:

*   **FIFO:** ₹200,000,000 - ₹163,000,000 = ₹37,000,000 (₹37,000 in thousands)
*   **LIFO:** ₹200,000,000 - ₹168,000,000 = ₹32,000,000 (₹32,000 in thousands)
*   **Weighted Average:** ₹200,000,000 - ₹165,000,000 = ₹35,000,000 (₹35,000 in thousands)

**Tax (30%):**

*   **FIFO:** ₹37,000,000 * 30% = ₹11,100,000 (₹11,100 in thousands)
*   **LIFO:** ₹32,000,000 * 30% = ₹9,600,000 (₹9,600 in thousands)
*   **Weighted Average:** ₹35,000,000 * 30% = ₹10,500,000 (₹10,500 in thousands)

**Profit After Tax (Net Income):**

Profit Before Tax - Tax:

*   **FIFO:** ₹37,000,000 - ₹11,100,000 = ₹25,900,000 (₹25,900 in thousands)
*   **LIFO:** ₹32,000,000 - ₹9,600,000 = ₹22,400,000 (₹22,400 in thousands)
*   **Weighted Average:** ₹35,000,000 - ₹10,500,000 = ₹24,500,000 (₹24,500 in thousands)

## Part 2: Cash Flow Analysis

Now, we analyze the cash flow under the assumption that all purchases and sales are on a cash basis.

**Cash from Sales:**

This is the same under all methods: 2,500 units * ₹80,000/unit = ₹200,000,000 (₹200,000 in thousands).

**Cash Paid to Suppliers (Purchases):**

This is also the same under all methods: (1,200 * ₹60,000) + (1,800 * ₹70,000) = ₹198,000,000 (₹198,000 in thousands).

**Net Cash Flow Pre-Tax:**

Cash from Sales - Cash Paid to Suppliers: ₹200,000,000 - ₹198,000,000 = ₹2,000,000 (₹2,000 in thousands).

**Tax Cash Outflow:**

This is the same as the tax calculated in Part 1.

**Net Cash Flow Post-Tax:**

Net Cash Flow Pre-Tax - Tax Cash Outflow:

*   **FIFO:** ₹2,000,000 - ₹11,100,000 = -₹9,100,000 (-₹9,100 in thousands)
*   **LIFO:** ₹2,000,000 - ₹9,600,000 = -₹7,600,000 (-₹7,600 in thousands)
*   **Weighted Average:** ₹2,000,000 - ₹10,500,000 = -₹8,500,000 (-₹8,500 in thousands)

## Key Observations

*   **Impact on Profit:** The choice of inventory method significantly impacts reported profit (net income). In this inflationary scenario, FIFO reports the highest profit, while LIFO reports the lowest.
*   **Pre-Tax Cash Flow:** Pre-tax cash flow is *not* affected by the inventory accounting method. This is because cash transactions (purchases and sales) are the same regardless of how inventory is costed.
*   **Post-Tax Cash Flow:** Post-tax cash flow *is* affected by the inventory method because the tax liability is different under each method. Since LIFO resulted in the lowest profit, it also resulted in the lowest tax outflow and therefore the least negative post-tax cash flow in this example.

## Conclusion

While inventory accounting methods influence reported profits and consequently tax liabilities and post-tax cash flows, they do *not* change the pre-tax cash flow of a business. This highlights the importance of understanding the difference between accounting profit and cash flow. While accounting policies can affect the timing of profit recognition, they cannot change the actual cash inflows and outflows from core business operations.
