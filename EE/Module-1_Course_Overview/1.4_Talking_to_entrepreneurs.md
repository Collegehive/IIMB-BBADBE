# Summary of Interview with Prof. Sathya Prasad

This is a summary of an interview with Professor Satya Prasad from the Centre of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) at PES University, Bangalore. He is a seasoned technology expert with experience at Intel and SEMI India.

## Early Life and Journey into Technology

Professor Prasad grew up in Bangalore in a middle-class family. His father worked in the railways, which allowed him to travel extensively. He was a curious child who enjoyed taking things apart to understand how they worked. This curiosity, combined with his travel experiences, fostered a broad perspective crucial for innovation. He pursued engineering as a first step towards changing his thinking.

## Key Career Milestones

*   **Master's Degree in the U.S.:** He pursued a master's degree to understand how to build large complex systems, particularly mainframe and mini-computers, as the personal computer revolution was beginning. He built an artificial intelligence integrated circuit using analog circuits, a concept now experiencing a resurgence. This experience taught him the value of perseverance through failures in the innovation process.
*   **Intel:** He spent nearly 20 years at Intel, working in various capacities, from engineering and marketing to strategy, planning, and product management. He considers Intel an “innovation factory” that helped him learn how to build and sell products.
*   **Intrapreneurship:** He chose to innovate within Intel rather than starting his own company during the dot-com boom. This intrapreneurial experience allowed him to learn about building, testing, marketing, and understanding customer needs.
*   **System on Chip (SoC):** He worked on a product that became a significant hit in data centers, particularly with social networking companies. The SoC incorporated security and networking innovations. The development process involved numerous failures and trials before achieving success, highlighting the iterative nature of innovation.
*   **Return to India:** In 2002, he returned to India as employee number one in Intel's Enterprise Platform Group (EPG), establishing the first server development center in India. This involved setting up infrastructure and resources from scratch.

## Transition to Education and CIE

*   **Guest Lecture at IIM Bangalore (2015):** This experience sparked his interest in teaching.
*   **Leaving Intel (2017):** He left Intel with a desire to teach.
*   **Joining PES University (2018):** He was tasked with setting up an innovation center, leading to the creation of CIE in January 2018.
*   **CIE's Mission:** CIE aims to provide students with a safe environment to start their entrepreneurial journeys, connect with collaborators, and access resources. Approximately 2000 students from various disciplines have participated in CIE programs.

## CIE Curriculum and Key Takeaways

The CIE curriculum focuses on three core elements:

*   **Learn:** Students learn about the entrepreneurial mindset, including effectuation, self-awareness, and various forms of entrepreneurship (social, for-profit, GovTech).
*   **Build:** Students form teams and develop business acumen, focusing on value creation, delivery, and extraction through business model development. They also create prototypes (product, business model, etc.).
*   **Share:** Students learn to effectively communicate their ideas and objectives.

The curriculum emphasizes that entrepreneurship is a team sport and that communication is crucial for turning hazy ideas into clear objectives.

## Key Insights on Innovation

*   Innovation is not solely driven by technology; technology is an enabler that provides scale, speed, and cost reduction.
*   A strong vision and the motivation to solve a problem are crucial starting points for innovation.
*   Building partnerships and working within teams are essential for successful innovation.
*   The innovation journey is full of ups and downs, twists and turns, and often doesn't go as initially planned.
*   Many large companies started in completely different industries (Wipro - vegetable oil, Nokia - paper, Samsung - construction).

The interview highlights the importance of curiosity, perseverance, teamwork, and a clear vision in the journey of innovation and entrepreneurship.
