# Necessity-Based Entrepreneurship

Necessity-based entrepreneurship, also known as survival entrepreneurship is defined as entrepreneurship driven by the need to survive rather than by the pursuit of opportunity. Common in emerging economies, such as India, where high levels of entrepreneurship are observed due to economic challenges.

It is driven by a lack of alternative employment opportunities or income sources. Here individuals turn to  enterpreneurship out of necessity, often due to unemployment, underemployment, economic hardship, or lack of social safety nets. 

The primary goal is to generate income for survival and basic needs which  contrasts with opportunity-based entrepreneurship, where individuals pursue business ventures to capitalize on perceived market opportunities and to distrupt the market.
