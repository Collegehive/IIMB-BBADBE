# Module 1 Important Questions

### 1. Write a short note on the origin of entrepreneurship.

Trade is a fundamental aspect of human commerce and humans are ‘ homo economicus’ (
we do business ) much before we started to converse with each other. Our ability to do
business, understand commerce, offer things to each other in exchange of what is valuable
to one has been there for centuries.

Early traders exchanged goods without verbal communication, highlighting the innate
human tendency to engage in commerce and it was known as silent trade.

For example, traders mostly from Europe go to Africa , put a bunch of products in a
particular location, then there would be locals who would come to look at the products,
and put gold/ valuable for it and take it, or just go back implying no deal.

Rapid technological advancements over the last century played a huge role in
entrepreneurial advancement, illustrating how innovations like flight and the internet have
transformed society.

### 3. Are entrepreneurs born or are they made?

In the 60s and 70s it was thought that entrepreneurs have certain capabilities that others
don’t have, such as ability to take high risk decisions, high tolerance for ambiguity and have
internal locus of control, and questionnaires were made based on the same.

It was noticed that not everyone who had high tolerance of risk was an entrepreneur and
not everybody how had low tolerence ambiguity was an employee. Which meant there isnt
entrepreneurial gene, these traits are not exclusive to entrepreneurs; they can be found in
people across various roles

### 4. Does society or culture have an influence over the entrepreneurial mindset?

Entrepreneurial mindset is significantly shaped by the socio-cultural environment in which
individuals grow and develop. These influences encompass a wide range of factors,
including cultural norms, values, beliefs, social structures, educational systems, and
economic conditions. Understanding these influences is crucial for comprehending why
entrepreneurship flourishes in some societies and faces challenges in others.

Socio-cultural factors play a profound role in shaping the entrepreneurial mindset. By
creating a supportive socio-cultural environment that encourages risk-taking, innovation,
and achievement, societies can unlock the full potential of their entrepreneurial talent.

Certain communities (e.g., Silicon Valley, Israel, Bangalore) have historically had advantages
in entrepreneurship due to their deep-rooted business cultures and control over resources.
To an extent it explains why entrepship was restricted to a particular community becoz the
learnings were residing only in those communities

Examples: * The diamond industry was historically controlled by Jewish communities. *
Indian communities like the Palanpuri were influential in diamond business.

**Modern View:**
- The traditional advantages of certain communities are diminishing. Access to
entrepreneurial knowledge and resources is now more widespread (e.g., online
platforms, government support).
- Entrepreneurship is increasingly seen as learnable and not restricted by geographical or
cultural boundaries.
- The barriers to starting a business have decreased, making entrepreneurship more
accessible to a broader range of people.
- Immigrants often become entrepreneurial in new countries, suggesting that
entrepreneurship can develop outside traditional cultural or regional contexts.
